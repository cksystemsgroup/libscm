Short-term Memory for Self-collecting Mutators
-----------------------------------------------
We propose a new memory model called short-term memory for 
managing objects on the heap. In contrast to the traditional per- 
sistent memory model for heap management, objects in short-term 
memory expire after a finite amount of time, which makes deallo- 
cation unnecessary. Instead, expiration of objects may be extended, 
if necessary, by refreshing. We have developed a concurrent, in- 
cremental, and non-moving implementation of short-term memory 
for explicit refreshing called self-collecting mutators that is based 
on programmer-controlled time and integrated into state-of-the-art 
runtimes of three programming languages: C, Java, and Go. All 
memory management operations run in constant time without ac- 
quiring any locks modulo the underlying allocators. Our implemen- 
tation does not require any additional heap management threads, 
hence the name. Expired objects may be collected anywhere be- 
tween one at a time for maximal incrementality and all at once for 
maximal throughput and minimal memory consumption. The inte- 
grated systems are heap management hybrids with persistent mem- 
ory as default and short-term memory as option. Our approach is 
fully backwards compatible. Legacy code runs without any modi- 
fications with negligible runtime overhead and constant per-object 
space overhead. Legacy code can be modified to take advantage of 
short-term memory by having some but not all objects allocated in 
short-term memory and managed by explicit refreshing. We study 
single- and multi-threaded use cases in all three languages macro- 
benchmarking C and Java and micro-benchmarking Go. Our results 
show that using short-term memory (1) simplifies heap manage- 
ment in a state-of-the-art H.264 encoder written in C without ad- 
ditional time and minor space overhead, and (2) improves, at the 
expense of safety, memory management throughput, latency, and 
space consumption by reducing the number of garbage collection 
runs, often even to zero, for a number of Java and Go programs.

libscm is the C library for short-term memory. It 
(1) provides short-term memory management for individual memory 
    requests (memory objects), 
(2) introduces short-term memory regions, which cluster multiple 
    memory requests into regions to prevent memory fragmentation 
    and provide constant time deallocation of multiple expired 
    objects, and 
(3) supports the use of multiple software clocks to enable
    flexible time management.



How to build libscm
--------------------
* Use a recent version of gcc. libscm is known to work with gcc 4.4.3
  on Linux x86 and x86_64
* run make to build the shared library
* the library (libscm.so) and the public header files reside in the dist 
  subdirectory
* run the unit tests located in the test subdirectory. To run the unit
  tests you have to compile libscm with the -DSCM_TEST flag.
* take a look at the examples subdirectory (c files and Makefile)
  to find out how to build a program using libscm.
* You can run the unit tests and examples with the provided run-*.sh
  scripts that set up the environment.
